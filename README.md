construct2_firebase_plugin
==========================

Intergration of Firebase with Scirra's construct 2 engine. Plugin discussed [here](http://www.scirra.com/forum/plugin-firebase_topic79393.html)

A modified [rex_hash](https://www.scirra.com/forum/plugin-hash-table_t65765) is included to avoid clashes with Firebase's JSON keys. Thanks Rex!

a standard [rex_date](https://www.scirra.com/forum/plugin-system-date-and-time_t63492) is included just for utility.

A real-time multiplayer demo is [here](https://construct2example.firebaseapp.com/pages/blog/latency_part1.html)
